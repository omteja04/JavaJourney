Java has 3 types of variables

- Local variables
  - Inside a class also inside a method
  - `Scope:` Within a block / method scope
- Instance variables (Non-Static)
  - Inside a class outside the method without static keyword These Belong to the instance of that class
  - `Scope:` Inside the same & outside the class with an instance
- Static/Class variables
  - Inside a class outside the method with static keyword
  - `Scope:` inside the class & outside the class with the ClassName directly



**Identifying Static and Non-Static Members**
- If a class member can be accessed directly by using ClassName that means those members are `Static`


- If there a need of creating a new instance to access class members then they are `Non-Static` members 
**Note: ** Static members can also be accessed using object.
