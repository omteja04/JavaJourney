**COPING THE PATH OF JAVA:-**
First of all go to `MY COMPUTER` and go to the drive where the java is installed.In that go to `PROGRAM FILES` and then double click on java folder.
In that we have observed there is a folder with name `java jdk`,double click on the `java jdk`folder and then go into the bin folder.
At this time we have to copy the path of the bin folder.

`c:\Program Files\java\jdk1.5.0_10\bin;`

**SETTING THE JAVA PATH:-**
In order to set the path of the java in our system,first of all we need to open `CONTROL PANEL` in our system and go to `SYSTEM SETTINGS`.
In system settings we need to go into the `ADVANCED SYSTEM SETTINGS` settings.
In advanced system settings we just click on `ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES`option.
In `USER VARIABLES` click on `NEW` button and type the **`path`** at `VARIABLE NAME`.
We need to paste the previously copied path of the bin folder at the place of `VARIABLE VALUE`.
Finally click on OK and then OK,then close the `MY COMPUTER` window.
Now the java path is set. We are ready to use java facilities in our computer.
