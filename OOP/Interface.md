1. You can achieve ðŸ’¯ % abstraction,using interfaces.
2. Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance Using Classes.
3. Interfaces support Multiple Inheritance.
4. Interfaces contains only abstract methods.
5. You need to write only the declaration of the method in the interfaces.
6. Classes can implement interfaces using `implements` keyword
7. The class that implements an interface should provide concrete implementation of the methods in the interface

```java
interface MyInterface {
    // abstract methods
}
```
